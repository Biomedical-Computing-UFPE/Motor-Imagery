# Motor-Imagery
This database consists of 21 EEG signal collections from a single healthy adult male. The collections were performed on alternate days and each one consists of 60 trials of 8 seconds. In each trial, in turn, the motor imagery of the right, left or feet is performed. EEG data were collected through the g.Hamp amplifier set to a sampling rate of 256 Hz. In addition, 27 active channels were distributed over the premotor, motor and sensoriomotor cortex.
After preparation and placement of the electrodes, the data acquisition protocol was performed as follows:
- The individual wearing an EEG sits in front of a Monitor.
- In a few moments, a cross appears to alert you of an impending instruction.
- An arrow will randomly indicate which activity to do in that trial. E.g.: arrow to the right will indicate motor imagery of the right hand, etc.
- The individual performs the indicated instruction within 8 seconds of the trial. It may or may not receive real-time feedback on the quality of its execution.
- The screen is completely white and the subject rests for 4 seconds.
- The process is repeated until completing 60 trials.

The study was conducted in compliance with the guidelines of Resolution 466/2012 of the National Health Council and the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964 and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Health Sciences Center of Federal University of Pernambuco, CAAE number 79271517.2.0000.5208, Recife, Brazil. All participants signed the Informed Consent Term (ICT) prior to the start of the research. Patients were informed of the goals and procedures, as well as the risks and benefits, and could interrupt the assessments at any time, without the need for further explanation.
